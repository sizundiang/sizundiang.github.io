This is my blog website bulit with Jekyll. I will share some blogs about what I'm working on, which is mostly about the technique and theories of software. Actually most of the articles are just migrated from my accounts on other websites like [Zhihu](https://zhihu.com) and maybe some of them are written years ago, I'll mark them with the date that they were first published on the Internet. Maybe you can find more in my GitHub account [sizundiang](https://github.com/sizundiang).
